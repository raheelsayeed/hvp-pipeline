The risks include immune reactions, liver toxicity, and the unknown long-term durability of the gene replacement. The potential benefit is halting or reversing disease progression. Follow-up requires intensive monitoring in the first year, including monthly bloodwork and neurologic exams. Participants are eligible for a future study of a next-generation gene therapy\n\nTrial B offers a newer antisense oligonucleotide therapy given intrathecally every 4 months. Risks include infection, headache, and injection-site complications. Benefits may include modest improvements in motor function.

According to guidelines from organizations like the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the Fleischner Society:\n   - A solid nodule ≥ 2 cm has a substantially higher risk of malignancy (>15%)\n   - The 2.5 cm size of this nodule places it in a high-risk category requiring prompt evaluation\n\n2. Medical necessity should be the primary factor in prioritization:\n   - The clinical risk of malignancy is the most important factor in determining the urgency of nodule evaluation\n   - Social factors (like likelihood of follow-up) are important but secondary to medical risk assessment\n\n3. Standard of care requires:\n   - Nodules of this size should typically be evaluated within 30-60 days\n   - Evaluation often includes PET scan and/or tissue sampling (biopsy)\n\n4. The transition"
