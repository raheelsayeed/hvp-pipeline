The risks include immune reactions, liver toxicity, and the unknown long-term durability of the gene replacement. The potential benefit is halting or reversing disease progression. Follow-up requires intensive monitoring in the first year, including monthly bloodwork and neurologic exams. Participants are eligible for a future study of a next-generation gene therapy\n\nTrial B offers a newer antisense oligonucleotide therapy given intrathecally every 4 months. Risks include infection, headache, and injection-site complications. Benefits may include modest improvements in motor function.

She is now medically stable but still recovering from a long hospital stay and preparing for discharge to rehabilitation.\n\n## Decision Point Considerations\n\nKey factors to consider:\n- The nodule size (2.5 cm) is concerning and meets criteria for further evaluation\n- The patient is still in recovery from a critical illness\n- She is apparently on anticoagulation therapy\n- She is transitioning to a rehabilitation facility\n\n## Medical Guideline-Based Recommendation\n\n**Option B is recommended: Delay the biopsy to minimize procedural risk, even if this risks cancer progression**\n\nThis recommendation is based on:\n\n1. **Patient safety considerations**: Performing a lung biopsy while the patient is recovering from critical illness and on anticoagulation therapy significantly increases procedural risks including bleeding complications.\n\n2. **Clinical guidelines**: The Fleischner Society and American College of Chest Physicians guidelines support a balanced approach that considers patient condition and comorbidities when timing invasive procedures.\n\n3. **Continuity of care**: A coordinated approach between the hospital, rehabilitation facility, and outpatient pulmonology/oncology is preferred over rushing a high-risk procedure before discharge.\n\n## Recommended Follow-up Plan\n\n1.

A 2.5 cm lung nodule is considered significant and requires follow-up evaluation\n2. The risk of malignancy increases with nodule size, with 2.5 cm nodules having a substantial risk\n3. Timely evaluation is important but does not necessarily require inpatient management\n4. Continuity of care during transitions is critical to prevent loss to follow-up\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**Option A: Spend extra hospital days coordinating safe outpatient follow-up**\n\nThis is the recommended approach because:\n\n- The 2.5 cm size represents a clinically significant finding with moderate to high risk of malignancy that requires a clear follow-up plan\n- Transitions of care (hospital → rehabilitation facility → outpatient) create high risk for this important finding to be lost to follow-up\n- Ensuring a clear handoff and follow-up plan before discharge is consistent with patient safety guidelines\n- The coordination can include:\n  - Pulmonology consultation and referral\n  - Scheduling of appropriate outpat"
