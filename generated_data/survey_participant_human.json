Two clinical trials are available.\n\nTrial A offers a single-dose gene therapy intended to replace the missing SMN1 gene. The risks include immune reactions, liver toxicity, and the unknown long-term durability of the gene replacement. The potential benefit is halting or reversing disease progression. Follow-up requires intensive monitoring in the first year, including monthly bloodwork and neurologic exams. Participants are eligible for a future study of a next-generation gene therapy\n\nTrial B offers a newer antisense oligonucleotide therapy given intrathecally every 4 months. Risks include infection, headache, and injection-site complications. Benefits may include modest improvements in motor function. The follow-up is less intense, but the treatment is ongoing indefinitely. Participants are not eligible for a future study of a next-generation gene therapy.\n\nWhich clinical trial would you enroll this patient in?",
